# 最后的一些想法

The last chapters of this book are to inspire you to apply what you've learned.
本书的最后几章希望能鼓励你去应用你所学到的. 

So far, the book has taught you how to use GraphQL in JavaScript on the client and server-side.
到目前为止, 本书已经教了你如何在JavaScript的客户端和服务端中使用GraphQL.

You used React on the client-side and Express on the server-side.
你可以在客户端用React, 在服务端用Express. 

On both ends you used Apollo for a sophisticated GraphQL library between both entities.
你也可以在两端用Apollo作为复杂的GraphQL库.

However, there is plenty of room to explore the ecosystem.
但是, 这个生态还有很多待开发的地方.

If you haven't completed all the exercises from the book or read all the articles, you should start with these.
如果你还没完成本书的所有练习, 读完本书所有的内容, 你应该先从它们开始.

Otherwise, let's see what else you can do to advance your GraphQL skills.
此外, 我们看看还可以做什么来提升GraphQL技能.


## 下一步学习路径

You built a couple of applications in this book.
你可以构建几个书里的应用程序.

While reading the chapters, you adapted the applications to apply advanced techniques (permission-based authorization), tools (GraphQL Playground) or features (GitHub commenting).
当你读那些章节的时候, 你在程序上运用高级技术(基于权限的论证),工具(GraphQL Playground) 或特性(GitHub commenting).

Perhaps you even followed all of the exercises closely in the book.
甚至你可能紧紧地跟上了书上的所有练习.

But that's not the end.
但那都不是终点.

There are many more features, techniques, and tools that you can apply to these applications.
还有许多特性, 技术, 和工具是你可以运用在那些应用上的.

Be creative and challenge yourself by implementing these on your own.
有创造性并且挑战自我去实现它们.


I am curious what you come up with, so don't hesitate to reach out to me.
我很期待看到你能想出什么, 所以新创意随时可以告诉我.



We used React on the client-side and Express on the server-side.
我们在客户端用React,在服务端用Express.

As GraphQL and also the Apollo libraries are framework agnostic, you can couple them with any other solution.
因为GraphQL和Apollo库都跨框架的, 你可以把它们和任何其它解决方案结合起来.

If you are familiar with Angular or Vue, you can transfer what you've learned about GraphQL and Apollo for building client-side applications with these frameworks.
如果你熟悉Angelar或者Vue, 你可以把你所学的GraphQL和Apollo知识, 迁移到用这些框架构建客户端程序.

If you are more into Koa or Hapi on the server-side, you can use these middleware libraries instead of Express as you have done in the book.
如果你对在服务端用Koa或Hapi更感兴趣, 你可以用这些中间件替代Express来做之前你在书中所做的.

The same applies for the database used for the GraphQL server application.
GraphQL服务程序所使用的数据库也同样适用.

In this book, you used PostgreSQL with the Sequelize ORM to connect your GraphQL resolvers to the PostgreSQL database.
书中, 你用PostgreSQL和Sequelize ORM去把你的GraphQL 解析器连接到PostgreSQL数据库上.

It's up to you to substitute PostgreSQL and Sequelize with something else like MongoDB and Mongoose.
取决于你要不要用其它的比如MongoDB和Mongoose来替代PostgreSQL和Sequelize.

Also, the Apollo client and server libraries can be substituted with other libraries from the ecosystem.
同样, Apollo 客户端和服务端的库也可以用生态里的相应的其它库来替代.

You read about them in the introductory chapters of this book.
你可以在本书的简介的章节里阅读它们.

You can also use [Yoga GraphQL](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga) and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) to get your GraphQL server up and running.
你也可以用[Yoga GraphQL](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga) 和 [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) 来启动和运行你的GraphQL服务器.

None of the technologies used in this book are set in stone, and you can substitute of them to build GraphQL applications with JavaScript.
本书里用到的所有技术都不是一成不变的, 你可以替换它们来用JavaScript构建GraphQL应用程序. 
 
 

My ultimate recommendation would be to continue with the Apollo Server application that you  built in this book, as it's an ideal starter kit to realize your own ideas.
我最大的建议是继续使用你在本书中所使用的Apollo Server. 因为它是一个理想的入门工具来实现你自己的想法.

As mentioned, you are free to substitute the technologies used under the hood, but it would be great to focus on the features for your application.
正如我之前提到的, 你可以自由地替换封装(在引擎盖下)的技术,但最好根据你的应用特性有选择地聚焦.

Since the user management is implemented for you, you can start to add your own features.
既然用户管理已经帮你实现了, 你就可以开始添加你自己的特性了.
